# Natural language processing course: `Automatic generation of Slovenian traffic news for RTV Slovenija`

This project aims to automate the generation of concise, accurate traffic news for RTV Slovenija. The current process relies on manual reporting every 30 minutes, which is both time-consuming and prone to error. By leveraging state-of-the-art large language models, prompt engineering techniques, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, the project seeks to deliver real-time, high-quality traffic updates.
