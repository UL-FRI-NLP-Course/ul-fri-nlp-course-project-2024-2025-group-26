  abstract = {In response to the problems of insufficient understanding of language characteristics, inaccurate semantic understanding, and inaccurate automatic summarization generation of Russian texts in current automatic summarization generation algorithms, this article would use the chatGpt system to study the algorithm for automatic summarization generation of Russian texts. The automatic summarization algorithm for Russian texts based on the ChatGPT system can effectively generate summaries for Russian texts. This algorithm utilizes ChatGPT's powerful natural language processing capabilities to deeply understand and analyze Russian texts, thereby generating concise and accurate summaries. The algorithm based on the ChatGPT system has an accuracy of over 97.64\% in generating Russian text summaries, and the average accuracy of Russian text summarization generation in 10 experiments is 98.23\%. This provides an effective solution for automatic summarization generation of Russian texts, and the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithm are verified through experiments.},

  abstract = {Neural headline generation models have recently shown great results since neural network methods have been applied to text summarization. In this paper, we focus on news headline generation. We propose a news headline generation model based on a generative pre-training model. In our model, we propose a rich features input module. The headline generation model we propose only contains a decoder incorporating the pointer mechanism and the n-gram language features, while other generation models use the encoder-decoder architecture. Experiments on news datasets show that our model achieves comparable results in the field of news headline generation.},
